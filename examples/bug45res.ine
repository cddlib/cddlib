Canonicalize the matrix.
Implicit linearity rows are:

Redundant rows are:3 4 5

Nonredundant representation:
The new row positions are as follows (orig:new).
Each redundant row has the new number 0.
Each deleted duplicated row has a number negative of the row that
represents its equivalence class.
 1:1 2:2 3:0 4:0 5:0
