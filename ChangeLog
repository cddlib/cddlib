cddlib Change Log
=================

.. current developments

v0.94m
====================

**Fixed:**

* Fix and error, where a non-redundant linearity could be considered redundant.
* Fix an optimization error in ViaShooting code so that the linear programs are now much smaller.
* Fixed memory leaks in the redundancy code.
* Updated version number in dd_DDVERSION define.



v0.94l
====================

**Fixed:**

* `extern C` block in cdd.h header for C++ (thanks to @jengelh)



v0.94k
====================
- header files are now installed to PREFIX/include/cddlib to avoid clashes
  with other libraries.
- configuration file for pkg-config added: assuming cddlib installed in
  <prefix> known to pkg-config, "pkg-config --cflags cddlib" etc will
  work. (Otherwise, one would need PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<prefix>/lib/pkgconfig).

v0.94jg
====================
- Thanks to Julian Rüth, modernized autotooling, mirrored
  code on GitHub, introduced cddexec as a replacement of
  cdd_both_reps that many distributions packaged, made
  randomization portable. Thanks to Matthias C. M. Troffaes, fixed
  representation type in dd_MatrixAppendTo.

v094ig
====================
- The missing definition of dd_set_d function in the case of
  -DGMPRATIONAL flag is used.  The only change is in cddmp.h.
  The use of this function is explained in testcdd2.c program.
  This function is useful when input is mostly float (real).
  Even such a case, running on the rational exact arithmetic
  might be helpful to debug the floating point computation.

v094hg
====================
- Thanks to Mathieu Dutour, one minor bug has been fixed.

v094gg
====================
- Thanks to both Anders Jensen and Mathieu Dutour
  a few memory leaks in cddlib.c and cddlp.c have been
  fixed.  Also, some patches sent by Jerry James have
  been applied.  These were for making the library
  shared and more compatible for C++ compilers.

v094fg
====================
- Thanks to Sven Verdoolaege's fixes,
  the "configure" script now uses "gcc" as the default
  compiler, rather than "g++" in earlier releases,
  and the libraries can be linked properly with
  both C and C++ programs.

v094eg
====================
- A bug of reporting a wrong (sign) certificate of
  an infeasible LP is fixed.  This bug reported by
  Charles Geyer, occurs if the exact GMP version of
  the dd_LPSolve is used with minimization. A bug of
  reporting infeasibility of a feasible LP with
  column non-full rank LP is fixed.  This bug was reported
  by Sven Verdoolaege.

v094dg
====================
- A bug of reporting a wrong unbounded direction vector of
  a dual inconsistent LP is fixed.  This bug occurs only
  if the exact GMP version of the dd_LPSolve is used.
  For example, this error may occur in scdd_gmp.  This
  error was reported by Lars Schewe.

v094cg
====================
- A bug for reading a rational number of length longer
  than 255 characters have been fixed. This was reported
  by Ruriko Yoshida. Now the longest
  number is controlled by dd_wordlenmax defined in
  cddtypes.h .  The longest line is also controlled by
  dd_linelenmax .  These are currently fixed to
  1024 and 4096.  Larger numbers and lines can be
  handled by modifying these numbers and recompilation.

v094bg
====================
- A bug for the representation conversion, reported by
  Michal Kvasnica, was fixed.  The earlier 094* versions
  prematurely terminate the conversion when the number
  of rows is equal to the number of columns in the input.
  This means the earlier 094* do not compute correctly
  for simplices, for example.

v094ag
====================
- A bug of dd_LPSolve is fixed.  This bug, reported by
  Dima Pasechnik, due to a mishandling of cycling of LP
  algorithms, is fixed.

v094g
====================
- dd_MatrixCanonicalize has been added.  This reduces
  matrix M to a minimal representation by computing
  all implicit linearity rows and all redundant rows.
  It applies lexicographic sorting of rows to remove
  duplicates before applying redundancy removal.
  This function combines the two computations together
  in more efficient manner than before.
  See the new redcheck.c for its use.  Several basic
  operations for matrices have been added, such as
  dd_MatrixRowsRemove and dd_MatrixRowsRemove2.

  The representation conversion dd_DDMatrix2Poly now
  handles the empty H-polyhedra properly, by calling
  an LP-based emptiness checker before running the double
  description algorithm.

  New functions finding specific points in H-polyhedra
  are added.  dd_ExistsRestrictedFace is a general inequality
  system solver with specified equations, inequalities and
  strict inequalities.   dd_FindRelativeInterior finds
  a point in the relative interior of a polyhedron.


v093dg
====================
- The problem of outputting the running log has been corrected.
  This problem and a solution was communicated by Charles Geyer.
  Now, a new global dd_boolean variable dd_log (= dd_FALSE by default)
  controls log output.  An scdd/lcdd bug of terminating with segmentation
  fault when an input polyhedron is numerically delicate has been
  corrected.  This bug was reported by Stefan Volkwein.

v093cg
====================
- A bug of Phase I of the dual simplex method in floating-point
  arithmetics is fixed.  The problem (bus error) occurred when input data
  is not appropriate for floating-point arithmetics.  The problem
  occurrs even for the GMP executables as the exact LP solver first
  tries to detect the terminal basis with float-point arithmetics.

v093bg
====================
- The nonterminating problem of the LP solver has been fixed.
  This was due to a cycling of the criss-cross method in
  floating-point arithmetics, that is extremely rare.
  Also, the phase I of the dual simplex method has been
  modified.  The auxiliary LP is perhaps less likely to
  be degenerate.

v093ag
====================
- The LP basis finding procedure dd_FindLPBasis2 has been
  updated.  The functions dd_Matrix2WeakAdjacency, dd_SRedundant and
  dd_SRedundantRows are added.  The manual has been updated.

v093g
====================
- dd_LPSolve with GMP now runs fisrt with floating point arithmetics
  and checks with GMP the correctness of the result. New functions dd_Matrix2Adjacency,
  dd_FourierElimination, dd_BlockElimination, dd_DDMatrix2Poly2 are added.
  Some minor memory leak problems are fixed. (Thanks to the excellent
  memory debugger valgrind on linux.)

v092bg
====================
- An illegal memory access for EqualityIndex reported by
  Thao Dang is fixed.  Another bug of lcdd_gmp which takes
  "real" data and return a false result is fixed.  It now warns
  that input is not correct for the exact arithmetic lcdd_gmp.
  This error was reported by Andras Salamon.

v092ag
====================
- Joerg Rambau kindly created an autoconf distribution of
  cddlib-092.  This version 092a is made from Rambau's
  version with a slight modification.  For the momoment,
  the Mathematica cdd interface, cddmathlink (in src-mathlink),
  still needs to be handled in the conventional manner by
  editing Makefile.

v092g
====================
- the default value of dd_almostzero is now set to 1.0E-7
  instead of 1.0E-6.  New functions are added for checking
  redundancy of H- and V- representations such as
  dd_Redundant, dd_RedundantRows, dd_ImplicitLinearity,
  dd_ImplicitLinearityRows, and dd_RayShooting.
  Also some basic operations on dd_MatrixPtr have been added such as
  dd_MatrixAppendTo, dd_MatrixRowRemove, dd_MatrixSubmatrix.

  The names of enumeration type variables have been modified.
  Now all names have prefix "dd_", e.g. Rational, Integer are
  now dd_Rational and dd_Integer.  This applies to TRUE and FALSE,
  which are now dd_TRUE and dd_FALSE.

v091dg
====================
- Memory leak in dd_FreeLPData and dd_FreeLPSolution are
  fixed.

v091cg
====================
- Bug to terminate before the completion of computation
  (to produce a segmentation fault) is fixed.  This
  bug was reported by Hugh Anderson.

v091bg
====================
- Numerous memory leak bugs with GMP exact arithmetic,
  reported by Marc Pfetsch, are fixed.  Also, a minor
  bug of cddlib to terminate with core dump, reported by
  Hugh Anderson, is fixed.  The messages printed to
  the standard output "stdout" are now sent to "stderr".
  This was suggested by Ingo Schurr.

v091ag
====================
- Memory leak problems when GMP is used are fixed for
  dd_InitializeAmatrix, dd_CreateMatrix and
  dd_Larger.  These bugs, reported by Marc Pfetsch,
  can be fatal if GMP is used and the functions are
  called many times.  It has no effect for floating-point
  arithmetic computation.

v091g
====================
- Memory leak in FreeDDMemory (cddcore.c)
  is fixed.  This bug, which might cause a serious problem,
  was reported by Shawn Rusaw.  Also, a bug reported by
  Istvan Csabai on dynamic row ordering is fixed.  This
  problem is most likely not affecting anyone, since the
  dynamic row ordering option is not available via the
  publicly released documentations.  David Avis contributed
  a sample cddlib code, lcdd.c, which runs like his convex
  hull code, lrs.  In particular, it is useful to generate
  standard output stream for piping in unix.

v090eg
====================
- A bug of reading very large integer values incorrectly
  is fixed.  The previous versions were truncating very large
  integer values to a number representable by long integer.

v090dg
====================
- Serious bugs of dd_CopyOutput, dd_CopyInequalities are fixed.
  This bug is found by Istvan Csabai.  Earlier versions 090*
  output wrong H-representations whenever the RHS constants
  are not nonnegative, even though the computation runs
  correctly internally.

v090cg
====================
- set_intialize is modified so that it allocates a smallest space even when
  a nonpositive length is requested.
  The bug of not outputting the origin is fixed
  when input is homogeneous inequality system and the cone contains
  no extreme rays.  Note that cddlib does not output this vertex
  when the homogeneous cone has extreme rays, since cddlib outputs
  a minimal representation.

- A new function dd_DDInputAppend is added.

- dd_DDMatrix2Poly replaces (and combines) the two old functions
  dd_Matrix2Poly and dd_DoubleDescription.

- dd_LPSolutionLoad is renamed as dd_CopyLPSolution.

v090bg
====================
- Thanks to Shawn Rusaw's great help, I could detect and fix many
  memory related problems (memory leak, out-of-bounds, etc).
  Also, when input is not regular (nonfull or containing line),
  cddlib did not generate adjacency/incidence properly and
  this version should work more correctly.

v090ag
====================
- a small bug fix in cddarith.c.  The bug is reported by Shawn Rusaw.

v090g
====================
- Major revision over the previous versions.  It can be now compiled
  with GMP rational (-DGMPRATIONAL) as well as the standard C double.
  cdd and lp codes are merged and easily called together.  Many functions
  and data types are modified and renamed.  It comes with a simple
  cdd/cdd+-type standalne program scdd which does the standard
  representation conversion (*.ine <-> *.ext) and outputs all four
  types of auxiliary files (*.icd, *.iad, *.ecd, *ead).  Although it
  lacks some functions such as preprojection of cdd+, scdd is potentially
  the most powerful cdd ever since it runs in the two arithmetics and
  it can handle any input.

  Because of the better readability and the overhead of employing
  function calls to do GMP arithmetic, the speed is little slower than
  cdd+-076 on both arithmetics C double and GMP rational.

v086g
====================
- A bug fixed in dd_LexSmaller that affercted the lexicographic
  ordering of input data.  This fix is essential for efficiency.
  Also several memory leaks have been fixed.  Many of these bugs
  were found by Mr. Masanori Sato of Tokyo Institute of Technology.
  Never released.

v085g
====================
- It can read rational data.  Several minor bugs have been fixed.
  The new makefile creates cdd and dplex library archives
  libcdd.a and libdplex.a for unix systems.

v080g
====================
- The first C-library version of cdd.  It is stilll very primitive
  and has no documentation.  See README.libcdd.   Unlike the existing
  versions of cdd/cdd+, cddlib can deal with essentially any input,
  namely, non-full-dimensional convex hull problems and
  vertex-free extreme point (i.e. generator) listing problems.  Also
  it comes with MathLink program cddmathlink that can be called from
  Mathematica to perform cdd operations.
