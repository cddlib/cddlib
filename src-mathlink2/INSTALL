This directory contains additional files necessary to
create cddmathlink2.  It does not follow the autoconfig
structure and the user must edit Makefile so that it
conforms to the local Mathematica installation.
In particular, Mathematica MathLink executables
and library files (distributed as Mathematica AddOn
package, MathLink/DeveloperKit) must be installed properly.  
Namely, the executables mcc and mprep are typically 
installed in /usr/local/bin, the library libML.a
in /usr/local/lib, and the header file mathlink.h
in /usr/local/include.

Once a correct Makefile is created, just type 
"make all" or "make ml".  

Before cddmathlink2 compilation, one must compile 
the cddlib libraries (libcdd.a and libcddgmp.a) which are
supposed to be in the lib-src and lib-src-gmp directories.  
It is perhaps necessary to compile cddlib using the GNU gcc 
compiler, not with g++.  This can be done by configuring
cddlib with

CXX=gcc ./configure

cddmathlink2 is a new version of cddmathlink which 
supports rational exact arithmetic with GMP.
I tested this only with Mathematica 4.1 on MacOS X.
It should not be difficult in principle to build it
on other Unix/Linux platforms.  On Windows, 
I do not know how the GMP library can be included
in a project of a mathlink-supported environment
such as Borland C/C++ and Metroworks' CordWarrior.
This seems to be the only potential problem.
