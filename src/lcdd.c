/*  This program behaves like lrs by David Avis.
    Usage: lcdd filein fileout
           lcdd filein          output to stdout
           lcdd                 input stdin, output stdout

    This allows things like
    lcdd file | lcdd    (should give a minimal rep of the input file on stdout)
    lcdd file | lrs
    lcdd < filein
